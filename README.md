## Current Goals
<hr>

#### Admin
- Admin can create cohorts and assign them to instructors and students

- Admin can reset passwords for users

#### Instructors
- Instructor can invite students to cohort
- Instructor can create many cohorts that have many students assigned to them
- Instructor can track the progress of individual students and compare them to each other on a graph
- Instructors can send messages to their students via a forum. THis will be in the form of an additional page that will be a message board for students *or* on the same home page for students

#### Students
- Students can see their progress and check their percentile compared to the cohort as a whole.

#### General
- Users can view the graph in different time filters (weekly, monthly, yearly)

- Users can change their account settings


## Done
<hr>

#### Admin
- Admins can create users with different types such as other admins, instructors and students

- Admins can see a list of users that are in the database



## Stretch Goals
<hr>

- On Page Load, the root route should redirect the user to the appropriate page. Currently, the root route directs the user to the login page on load.

- Check out other API's that give information about user time coding. Currently the API that we are using can only track the number of commits per day whereas tracking coding time we believe is more crucial. E.g. Wakatime allows you to see your time spent coding and the languages used
